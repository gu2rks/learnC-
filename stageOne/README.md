# Stage One: Wellcome to C++ world
In this stage, Im going to do some simple c++ programs

## You can find all ADCENTURES here:
* stepZero: try out if everything work :D

* Adventure 1: Number of seconds
    Write a program Seconds.cpp which reads three integers (hours, minutes, seconds) and then computes the corresponding time measured in seconds. For example, 1 hour, 28 minutes and 42 seconds is equal to 5322 seconds

* Adventure 2:  BMI
    Write a program BMI.cpp which computes the BMI (Body Mass Index) for a person. The program will read length and weight from the keyboard and then present the result as output. The BMI is computed as weight/(length)^2, where the length is given in meters and the weight in kilograms. An example of an 

* Adventure 3: Time
    Write a program Time.cpp, which reads a number of seconds (an integer) and then prints the same amount of time given in hours, minutes and seconds

* Adventure 4: Sum of three
    Write a program SumOfThree.cpp which asks the user to provide a three digit number. The program should then compute the sum of the three digits.

* Adventure 5: Change ("Hard mode")
    Write a program Change.java that computes the change a customer should receive when he has paid a certain sum. The program should exactly describe the minimum number of Swedish bills and coins that should be returned rounded off to nearest krona (kr).
