# Stage One: Wellcome to C++ world
In this stage, Im going to do some simple c++ programs

## You can find all ADCENTURES here:
* stepZero: try out if everything work :D

* Adventure 1: Number of seconds

    Write a program Seconds.cpp which reads three integers (hours, minutes, seconds) and then computes the corresponding time measured in seconds. For example, 1 hour, 28 minutes and 42 seconds is equal to 5322 seconds

* Adventure 2:  BMI

    Write a program BMI.cpp which computes the BMI (Body Mass Index) for a person. The program will read length and weight from the keyboard and then present the result as output. The BMI is computed as weight/(length)^2, where the length is given in meters and the weight in kilograms. An example of an 

* Adventure 3: Time

    Write a program Time.cpp, which reads a number of seconds (an integer) and then prints the same amount of time given in hours, minutes and seconds

* Adventure 4: Sum of three 

    Write a program SumOfThree.cpp which asks the user to provide a three digit number. The program should then compute the sum of the three digits.

* Adventure 5: Change ("Hard mode")

    Write a program Change.cpp that computes the change a customer should receive when he has paid a certain sum. The program should exactly describe the minimum number of Swedish bills and coins that should be returned rounded off to nearest krona (kr).

* Adventure 6: Fahrenheit to Celsius

    Write a program Convert.cpp, which reads a temperature in Fahrenheit and then converts it to Celsius using the formula:

        C = (F-32)*5/9

* Adventure 7: Short Name

    Write a program ShortName.java, reading a first name and a last name (given name and family name) as two Strings. The output should consist of the first letter of the first name followed by a dot and a space, followed by the first four letters of the last name. An example of an execution:

        First name: Anakin
        Last name: Skywalker
        Short name: A. Skyw

* Adventure 8: Random Number

    Write a program TelephoneNumber.cpp, generating and printing a random telephone number of the form 0XXX-ZYYYYY. The area code consists of a zero followed by three digits (X). The local number can not start with a zero (Z), all other digits (Y) are random.

* Adventure 9: Square Root

    Write a program Distance.cpp which reads two coordinates in the form (x,y) and then computes the distance between the points, using the formula

    distance = Sqrt( (x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 )

    Sqrt() means "the square root of" and ^ means "raised to". The answer should be presented with three decimal digits.

* Adventure 10: Wind Chill (HARD MODE)

    Write a program WindChill.cpp that asks the user for a temperature (Â°C) and the wind speed (measured in m/s) and then computes the so-called wind chill temperature Twc using the Wind Chill Index formeln:

            Twc = 13.12 + 0.6215*T - 11.37*V^{0.16} + 0.3965*T*V^{0.16}
            

    where T is the temperature (Celsius) and V is the wind speed (kilometers per hour). Notice you must convert the wind speed from meter per second to kilometers per hour before you can apply the formula. And we expect you to present the result with one decimal (correctly rounded off).
